== ARM Build Image

This is a image build on top of an Ubuntu LTS release (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).

We adding some build dependencies:

* *cmake* 3.16.3 from source because the Ubuntu package supports version 3.12.1 which hasn't all target methods implemented. 
* *git* for accessing the source code
* *python* 3.x with the requests module to handle REST-API calls
* *gcc-arm-none-eabi*  9.2.1 20191025 (release) [ARM/arm-9-branch revision 277599] from https://developer.arm.com
